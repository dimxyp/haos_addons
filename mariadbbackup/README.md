# 🗄️ MariaDB Backup Add-on for Home Assistant OS

This is a Home Assistant OS-compatible add-on that creates scheduled and manual backups of Home Assistant MariaDB database.

It uses `mariadb-dump` to export the database and stores the result as a timestamped `.sql` file in the `/share` directory.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

The `run.sh` script:

1. Connects to the running MariaDB container used by Home Assistant.
2. Runs a `mariadb-dump` of all databases using credentials stored in `/data/secrets.txt`.
3. Saves the `.sql` backup file to custom location.

---

## 🔐 Credentials

You must provide database credentials and backup location in the add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "DB_HOST": "core-mariadb",   # your HA MariaDB - https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/mariadb
  "DB_USER": "homeassistant",
  "DB_PASS": "YOUR_DB_PASSWORD",
  "DB_BACKUPDIR": "/share/... /config/... or any other"
}
```

🚀 Manual Backup

You can trigger a manual backup by restarting the add-on or calling the script from the container:

```
bash /run.sh
```
